# TIL

Hello

I'm Maxim Krivoguz. I'm QA in Waverley Software. I want to learn Automated Testing because it helps me in the future

Today I learned basic Github staff like:
Created an open source repository.
Started and managed a new branch.
Changed a file and committed those changes to GitHub.
Opened and merged a Pull Request.
