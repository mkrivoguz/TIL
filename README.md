Hello

I'm Maxim Krivoguz. I'm QA in Waverley Software. I want to learn Automated Testing because it helps me in the future.

## May 26

Today I learned basic Github staff like:
Created an open source repository.
Started and managed a new branch.
Changed a file and committed those changes to GitHub.
Opened and merged a Pull Request.

## June 4

Today I learned(or remember) how to install Linux OS on the virtual machine, deployed the web service using docker, and written script. I have spent a lot of time on it.
